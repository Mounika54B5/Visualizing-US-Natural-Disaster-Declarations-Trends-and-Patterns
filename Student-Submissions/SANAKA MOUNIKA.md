#Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations

Project Description

The Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations project focuses on analyzing and presenting insights from FEMA’s disaster declaration data across the United States. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires affect millions of people and cause significant economic losses every year. However, understanding the patterns, frequency, and impact of these disasters can be challenging due to the large and complex datasets involved.
